A folder is provided that contains subfolders and scripts. Put â‰¥1 original face photo into the folder 'examples/ori' and run 'main.py'. Then you can obtain the phenotype quantization values corresponding to all files and their distribution positions (Z-score) relative to the reference values provided in this paper. The results will be inthe folder 'examples'. 
*:Since Face++ (https://www.faceplusplus.com.cn/) is a paid software (very cheap for each sample), users need to provide the paid account password to use the script we provided, or contact them to deploy the local server and modify the script provided by us before use.

In the folder 'models', there are 24 machine learning models (12 for DS and 12 for PRS).
